# Python-Portfolio
This is a collection of all of the works I (Zaara) have coded from AP Computer Science Principles at Jones College Prep in the 2024-2025 school year. Enjoy!


Project 1: Simple Calculator
Summary: This code creates a computer-based calculator that can help people learn the basic operations! There are options for the user to choose which operation they want to use.
Key Features:
- Gives user five options; the fifth is the option to quit using calculator
- User can input two numbers they need to create an equation
- Calculator displays output of equations

Project 2: 99 Bottles
Summary: After running this code, the computer will display the "99 Bottles" rhyme song! It will go all the down from 99 bottles to no more bottles left.
Key Features:
- Displays the song lyrics for every number of bottles left (except for 1 and 0)
- Requires only running the program for it to work
- Changes lyrics once the bottles start to run out

Project 3: MadLibs Generator
Summary: A player can input in all kinds of words--from verbs, to colors, to even objects! Once they no longer need to, the computer displays their inputs in a funny MadLibs story.
Key Features:
- Asks user to put in their own choices of words
- Funny story is given to the user once all words have been collected
- The same story will be displayed, but words can be changed after running program more than once

Project 4: Names Generator
Summary: A user will be asked multiple questions that allow them to pick between two things. Each choice will eventually lead them to what their real Painting Name is! The paintings are real ones from master artists.
Key Features:
- Uses "If" statements to determine the next choice for users once they pick between two things
- Each answer gives a new option, so the player will be led to their name
- The painting options are real and very unique to each user

Project 5: Pokemon Evolution Game
Summary: A player will get to train "Squirtle," so he can eventually evolve into his final form, "Wartortle!" The player has options for what they want their Pokemon to do next every day.
Key Features:
- Displays images of the player's Pokemon once it reaches a certain level and can evolve or if it is resting!
- There are "gym battles" and a "boss battle" that allows the player to choose the Pokemon's move for attack
- The player can view their Pokemon's evolution over the course of days; they can quit the game if they want to

Project 6: Magic 8 Ball Generator
Summary: Once the program initiates, the user will be displayed a "real" magic 8 ball that will tell them their fortune once the user inputs a yes-or-no question into the program.
Key Features:
- Displays a picture of a magic 8 ball created through ASCII text (not created by me)
- While loops are used so that the user can keep asking the magic 8 ball questions (unless they do not want to, and they can exit the program)
- time.sleep() is used so that the action of shaking the magic 8 ball can be displayed on screen!

Project 7: Stardom Adventure
Summary: The user becomes their own popstar and goes on a journey through numerous options of their choosing, so they can become the ultimate popstar! The game acts like a Build-Your-Own-Adventure game.
Key Features: 
- "If-" statements are used so that the user's input of choosing an option enables a new code segment to occur
- The user can view their popstar "stats" through certain options
- Based on how many points a user has, that determines the level of fame and success they achieve

Project 8: Image Recommender
Summary: Once the program initiates, the user will be displayed an image of a place around the world at random. Each image has an accompanying description so that user's understand why they should travel to these places!
Key Features:
- Real images (that are cited in the code) taken from online are used and displayed in the Interactive Window
- Printed statements get displayed after delayed timing so that there's more visual appeal
- The computer generates thoughtful descriptions of each place so that the user learns about where an image was taken

Project 9: Closet Builder
Summary: For those who struggle to find the perfect outfit for certain occasions, this program is for you! Users can select from multiple options to build their personal digital closet and find inspiration on what clothes should make up their wardrobe.
Key Features:
- Real images (that are cited in the code) taken from online are used and displayed in the Interactive Window
- User's inputs can add or remove items from their closet list
- ASCII text (that is cited from its creator in the code) is used to boost the visual appeal of the program
- Loops are used to assess items found within lists and either add or change nothing to them
