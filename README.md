# Python-Portfolio
This is a collection of all of the works I (Zaara) have coded from AP Computer Science Principles at Jones College Prep. Enjoy!


Project 1: Simple Calculator
Summary: This code creates a computer-based calculator that can help people learn the basic operations! There are options for the user to choose which operation they want to use.
Key Features:
- Gives user five options; the fifth is the option to quit using calculator
- User can input two numbers they need to create an equation
- Calculator displays output of equations

Project 2: 99 Bottles
Summary: After running this code, the computer will display the "99 Bottles" rhyme song! It will go all the down from 99 bottles to no more bottles left.
Key Features:
- Displays the song lyrics for every number of bottles left (except for 1 and 0)
- Requires only running the program for it to work
- Changes lyrics once the bottles start to run out

Project 3: MadLibs Generator
Summary: A player can input in all kinds of words--from verbs, to colors, to even objects! Once they no longer need to, the computer displays their inputs in a funny MadLibs story.
Key Features:
- Asks user to put in their own choices of words
- Funny story is given to the user once all words have been collected
- The same story will be displayed, but words can be changed after running program more than once

Project 4: Names Generator
Summary: A user will be asked multiple questions that allow them to pick between two things. Each choice will eventually lead them to what their real Painting Name is! The paintings are real ones from master artists.
Key Features:
- Uses "If" statements to determine the next choice for users once they pick between two things
- Each answer gives a new option, so the player will be led to their name
- The painting options are real and very unique to each user

Project 5: Pokemon Evolution Game
Summary: A player will get to train "Squirtle," so he can eventually evolve into his final form, "Wartortle!" The player has options for what they want their Pokemon to do next every day.
Key Features:
- Displays images of the player's Pokemon once it reaches a certain level and can evolve or if it is resting!
- There are "gym battles" and a "boss battle" that allows the player to choose the Pokemon's move for attack
- The player can view their Pokemon's evolution over the course of days; they can quit the game if they want to
